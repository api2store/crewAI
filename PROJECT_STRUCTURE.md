## Structure Explanation

- `src/`: Contains all source code for the project
  - `frontend/`: UI components, pages, and styles
  - `backend/`: Server-side logic, API endpoints, and services
  - `ai/`: AI model integration, training scripts, and inference logic
  - `shared/`: Common types and constants used across the project

- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests for all components

- `docs/`: Project documentation, including API references and architecture diagrams

- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for setup, building, and deployment

- `config/`: Configuration files for different environments

This structure supports the development of a generative AI application for creating images for social media by:

1. Separating concerns between frontend, backend, and AI components
2. Providing clear organization for each team member's primary focus areas
3. Encouraging modular development and easy integration of components
4. Supporting scalability and maintainability of the codebase
5. Facilitating collaborative development through well-defined interfaces between components

The structure allows for easy expansion and modification as the project grows and evolves.
